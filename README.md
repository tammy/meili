Travel planning app, to travel with friends without the headache of planning with them.

## Setup
1. Install `npm` and `nodemon` globally on your machine.
2. In the home directory, run `npm run setup`.
3. Run `npm run start` to start the frontend and backend servers concurrently.
6. Once you see that two servers are running (there might be a compile time lag for the frontend), connect to `localhost:8080` on your browser to see the application running.
